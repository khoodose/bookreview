    - 'Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior'
    - Rom and Ori Brafman take us on a tour of how irrational behaviour can set in
      and cause us to make sometimes catastrophic errors.  The one major takeaway?  Don't
      become Jacob Van Zanten.  How's that for a teaser?

    - Vernon God Little
    - 'In this 2004 Booker Prize Winner (a debut novel no less), the adolescent misfit
      Vernon tries to escape the clutches of his hometown and find a way forward for
      him and his mother.  Hilarity ensues as Vernon philosophizes and bounces from
      shenanigan to shenanigan.  Highlight: Emmanuel Kant is rediscovered as Immaculate
      C**t.'
